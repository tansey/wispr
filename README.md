Wispr - Streetview for Audio
============================

What is it?
-----------
An experimental site built overnight for the [HackTX](https://www.facebook.com/events/379326525472947/) hackathon. The idea is to pair this site with a smart phone app so people can record sounds in their part of the world and share them with others. Some questions:

    - How does Italy sound compared to Japan?
    - How does a busy street in New York sound compared to a quiet neighborhood in Oregon?

Each sound is tagged with GPS coordinates and displayed as a Google Maps overlay.

Where can I try it?
-------------------
The demo is available [here](wisprly.herokuapp.com).

What is it built on?
--------------------
Python, Flask, Heroku, JS, and Android. Currently using the Google Maps API.
